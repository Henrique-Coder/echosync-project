## ECS-P ・ EchoSync Project (All the best for epic music)

</center>

<center>

**ECS-P** is an open source project that supports up to Python version 3.11.9, which allows you to download music and playlists quickly and intuitively. It uses [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) as a music search source, the [yt-dlp](https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp) library to download the songs and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to re-encode the songs, improving their metadata and the overall file.

### Available features (v1.1.7)

In the list below, it shows everything that **ECS-P** can do...

- It can download songs by any online supported music platform (with shortened links or not);
- It can download songs by song name;
- Can download a list of songs by a text file;
- Supports downloading individual songs or playlists from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com), [TikTok Music](https://music.tiktok.com), [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com);
- And much more!

* **Note 1:** The program will automatically detect the music platform by the link used. Unavailable links or platforms will be automatically rejected. Texts detected as the title of a song
  will automatically be added to the download queue and the search for the song will take place via YouTube.
* **Note 2:** The program uses proprietary web scrapping techniques to extract the name/author of the song on the
  detected platform and will download it directly from YouTube.
